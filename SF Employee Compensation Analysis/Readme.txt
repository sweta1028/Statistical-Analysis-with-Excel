OVERVIEW
Our team will be conducting a multiple regression analysis of the 2013-2019 San Francisco public employees compensation dataset. The regression analysis will be used to predict the total compensation of a public employee.  
GOALS
1.	Quantitatively gain insights on the relationships between each dimension within the dataset. 
2.	Use the dataset as a predictor for total compensation.
SPECIFICATIONS
We will use data from 2013 to 2019 derived from The San Francisco Controller’s Office which is comprised of summarized employee compensation. The metrics for our independent variables will include average total salary, minimum total salary, max total salary, average total benefits, minimum total benefits, maximum total benefit, minimum total compensation, and maximum total compensation. The variable for our dependent variable will be the average total compensation. We will be using Microsoft Excel in order to process the information. Python could be used depending on the complexity of processing the information due to the size of the dataset.
